# Instances

This page showcases sudo-flix instances hosted by the community. 

<Note>
* Sites with a `⭐` next to them are the best ones to use.
* Sites with a `💾` next to them use the sudo-backend meaning your data is synced across these sites.
* Sites with a `📱` next to them have PWA support meaning you can use the site as a native app on your phone.
